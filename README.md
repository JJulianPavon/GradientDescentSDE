# GradientDescentSDE


In this repository, we include all code files to replicate our results

To reproduce the Geometric, Logistic and Protein Kinetic use:

1.- run Gradient_Descent_Process.jl

In each process it is generated a 100 observations with the set parameters.
And therefore, at the end it is calculated the sigma estimation based on quadratic variation and several examples with different starting point for the drift parameter.
