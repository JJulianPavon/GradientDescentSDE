# GradientDescentSDE


In this repository, we include all code files to replicate our results

To reproduce the Geometric Brownian process, Logistic  and Protein Kinetic use:

1.- run Gradient_Descent_Process.jl

In each process it is generated a 100 observations with the set parameters.
And therefore, at the end it is calculated the sigma estimation based on quadratic variation and one example with a starting point for the drift parameter.
